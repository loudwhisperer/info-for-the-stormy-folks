## Description

Weather or not was considered at great length, the result of which led to an idea... really a simple one why would anyone want to use the weather app on their phones when they can open a browser, and use a less pretty knock off that only gives you the weather from noon to three everyday?

Well i'll tell you because mine is better at least thats what my mom told me....

It does solve the need to check the weather if for some reason you only need the forecast from noon to three for six consecutive days.

I learned quite a bit from this one namely how to create an asynchronous function and accounnt for errors in two ways once in a try catch for the whole app and a second time for the fetch if it doesnt return a 200 upon running the application. Also how to adjust what part of the info a for loop starts on really saved me in not printing over forty cards after the user searches.
